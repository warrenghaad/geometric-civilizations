## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Core Concept

This project traces the evolution of geometric thinking across civilizations and time, showing how shape complexity progressed through four distinct stages:

1. **OBSERVATIONAL** (75,000 BCE - 3000 BCE) → Direct perception, natural patterns
2. **RULE-BASED** (3000 BCE - 1500 CE) → Mathematical systems, algorithms
3. **SYMBOLIC** (500 BCE - 1700 CE) → Spiritual meaning, sacred geometry
4. **PERSONALIZED** (1900 CE - Present) → Individual metaphor, abstract assemblage

### Four Shape Throughlines

The project tracks how four fundamental shapes evolved:
- 🔵 **CIRCLE** - Wheels → Orbits → Networks → Infinity
- 📏 **LINE** - Writing → Perspective → Fractals → Sequence
- ⬜ **SQUARE** - Grids → Architecture → Pixels → Modularity
- 🌀 **SPIRAL** - Growth → Cycles → Recursion → Time
