Today, a temple priest has ordered a special seal with 8 flower petals to honor Shamash, the sun god."

Divide evenly, and the gods smile.' Ninsun picks up her copper scribe and begins to calculate...",

    "civilization": "Mesopotamia (Akkadian/Babylonian)",
    "summary": "Long ago, the Mesopotamian people had no way to mark time or measure the sky. Shamash, the sun god of justice and light, took pity on humanity and gave them the gift of the divided circle—teaching them to split the sun's path into equal parts. This myth explains why the ancient Babylonians divided circles into 360 parts and why rosette patterns with 6, 8, 12, or 16 petals appear on cylinder seals, temple walls, and sacred objects.",

        "narration": "In the beginning, Shamash the sun god rose each morning from the mountains of the east, flooding the land between the two rivers with golden light. The people of Mesopotamia watched the sun travel across the sky, but they could not measure its path. They could not count the days or predict the seasons. 'How will we know when to plant our barley?' the farmers cried. 'How will we know when the great floods will come?'",

'I will teach you the secret of the circle,' Shamash declared. His body glowed with divine light—16 rays extending from his shoulders and crown. 'See how my rays divide the circle into equal parts? This is how you will measure time, space, and the movements of the heavens.'",

        "narration": "The high priest took a reed and drew a perfect circle in wet clay. 'Divide it,' Shamash commanded. The priest carefully marked 8 points around the edge—one for each direction (north, south, east, west, and the four corners between). Shamash smiled. 'Good. But there is more to learn.

        "narration": "As the priest watched, the 8 marks began to glow. Petals of light grew from each point, forming a beautiful flower—a rosette—radiating from the center.

        "narration": "From that day forward, the people of Mesopotamia used Shamash's gift. Seal carvers divided circles into 6, 8, 12, or 16 equal parts, creating rosette patterns that rolled perfectly. Architects built ziggurats with walls that faced the sacred directions. Astronomers tracked the stars by dividing the sky into 360 parts—a system we still use today. And every time someone divided a circle into equal groups, they remembered Shamash's teaching: 'Count by groups, and the patterns of the universe reveal themselves.'",

Acknowledge that cylinder seals were not just art—they were legal documents, religious symbols, and mathematical tools. Seal carving was a respected, skilled profession."
