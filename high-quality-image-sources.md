# High-Quality Image Sources: Geometric Pattern Evolution

## Overview: From Observation to Personalized Metaphor

This document catalogs high-quality image sources that demonstrate the progression of shape complexity:

1. **OBSERVATIONAL** → Patterns based on direct observation of nature and environment
2. **RULE-BASED** → Systematic geometric rules and mathematical principles
3. **SYMBOLIC** → Shapes carrying spiritual, cosmological, and cultural meaning
4. **PERSONALIZED ASSEMBLAGES OF METAPHOR** → Individual expression through geometric forms

- Believed to channel "High Masters"
- Work not shown publicly per her wishes until 20 years after death
- Female pioneer excluded from early abstract art canon

### Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944)

**What makes this personalized metaphor:**
- "Inner necessity" - personal spiritual expression through geometry
- Each shape carries personal and universal spiritual meaning
- Not copying visible world but expressing invisible (emotions, spirituality, soul)
- Synesthesia - saw colors when hearing music
- Personal geometric vocabulary evolves throughout life

- **Colors** = spiritual vibrations with specific emotional effects

**Theoretical Framework:**
- "Concerning the Spiritual in Art" (1910) - manifesto
- "Point and Line to Plane" (1926) - geometric theory
- Theosophical influence: creation as geometric progression (point → circles → triangles → squares)
- Bauhaus teaching (1922-1933): merged metaphysical meaning with design principles
