## 🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW

### Core Concept

Create 48 complete lessons teaching geometric thinking through Mesopotamian civilization, connecting:
- **Ancient Myths** → Storytelling and cultural context
- **Artifacts** → Visual analysis and observation
- **Geometry** → Mathematical concepts and patterns
- **Hands-on Activities** → Practical application

### The Four-Part Structure (Per Lesson)

Each of the 48 lessons follows this format:

1. **MYTH SECTION** (3 text segments)
   - Introduction: Sets the scene with gods/heroes
   - Journey: Geometric discovery through narrative
   - Resolution: Mathematical insight revealed

2. **ARTIFACT ANALYSIS** (3-5 museum artifacts)
   - High-resolution images
   - Geometric overlay annotations
   - Historical context
   - Visual storytelling bridges from myth

3. **MATHEMATICAL CONTENT**
   - Concept definitions
   - Worked examples
   - 5+ practice problems per lesson
   - Progressive difficulty

4. **HANDS-ON ACTIVITIES** (2 per lesson)
   - Building projects
   - Drawing exercises
   - Measurement activities
   - Pattern creation
